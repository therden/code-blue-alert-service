      # About the **codeblue.info** website

      ### As a free service to New York State residents, [codeblue.info](https://codeblue.info/) hosts a separate web page for each County showing whether the [National Weather Service](https://www.weather.gov/)'s afternoon forecast calls for sustained wind chill temperatures low enough to trigger provision of State-mandated [**Code Blue**](codeblue.info/about/codeblue) shelter services.

      ### We plan soon to offer a *paid subscription service* that will send daily notifications (via email, text, or both) indicating whether the forecast for a particular district should trigger a Code Blue Alert.  Both individual and group subscriptions will be available.

      [Alternatively, a district will be able to pay a small amount -- equivalent to XX individual subscriptions -- to allow an unlimited number of individuals to subscribe to those notices.]: #

      ### Other, related services may be added to this site later.
