      # About this Site

      ### As a free public service, [codeblue.info](https://codeblue.info/) hosts New York county-specific web pages that show whether the National Weather Services' forecasts anticipate sustained wind chill temperatures low enough to trigger the [**Code Blue** services](codeblue.info/about/codeblue) as mandated by New York State.

      ### We plan soon to offer a *paid subscription service* to allow individuals to receive daily notifications (via email, text, or both) regarding whether the forecast for a given district will trigger a Code Blue Alert.
      [Alternatively, a district will be able to pay a small amount -- equivalent to to allow an unlimited number of individuals to subscribe to those notices.]: #

      ### Other related services may be added.  Please reach out if you have any ideas!
