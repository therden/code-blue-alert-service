    content: "# About this Site\n\n### As a free public service, [codeblue.info](https://codeblue.info/) hosts New York county-specific web pages that show whether the National Weather Services' forecasts anticipate sustained wind chill temperatures low enough to trigger the [**Code Blue** services](codeblue.info/about/codeblue) as mandated by New York State.\n\n### We plan soon to offer a paid subscription service to allow individuals to receive daily notifications (via email, text, or both) regarding whether the forecast for a given district will trigger a Code Blue Alert.  Alternatively, a district will be able to pay a small amount to allow an unlimited number of individuals to subscribe to those notices.\n\n### "
