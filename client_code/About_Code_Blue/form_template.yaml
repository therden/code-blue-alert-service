      # About 'Code Blue'

      ### [New York State law](https://www.law.cornell.edu/regulations/new-york/18-NYCRR-304.1) requires that each county's Department of Social Services must provide shelter to _all_ persons who present as homeless -- without regard to their eligibility for other Federal- or State-funded programs -- whenever the National Weather Services forecasts wind chill temperatures will fall to 32° Fahrenheit or lower.

      ### This program is overseen by the State's [Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance](https://otda.ny.gov/), which periodically issues directives on the subject to the local districts who administer it.  The [most recent of these](https://otda.ny.gov/policy/directives/2024/LCM/24-LCM-13.pdf) was released on October 11, 2024.

      ### This directive states that, from October 1st through June 30th, every district must determine by 5:00 p.m. each day whether to declare a **Code Blue Alert** for the overnight to come.

      ### Once an Alert has been declared, the district must provide shelter from inclement weather until *either* 7:00 a.m. the next morning *or* actual wind chill temperatures rise above 32˚F -- whichever comes **later**.

      ### The State reimburses counties for qualified Code Blue costs at a rate of 100%, but only up to a district-specific maximum.  Costs that exceed that cap remain 100% locally-funded.  Both the number of persons who need to be sheltered under the program and the resources available to serve them vary at different points in time and across districts.  As a consequence of this differences, as well as other factors, Code Blue shelter may take a variety of forms, ranging from a warming station, to a supervised congregate sleeping space, to a motel room.
