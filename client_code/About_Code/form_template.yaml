      # About Code Blue

      ### [New York State law](https://www.law.cornell.edu/regulations/new-york/18-NYCRR-304.1) requires that each county's social services district must work with law enforcement to provide services to all persons who present as homeless -- without regard to their eligibility for services through any other Federal or State program -- whenever the National Weather Services forecasts wind chill temperatures will fall to 32Â° Fahrenheit or lower.

      ### The state's [Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance](https://otda.ny.gov/) periodically issues directives to local districts regarding this program.  The [most recent of these](https://otda.ny.gov/policy/directives/2024/LCM/24-LCM-13.pdf) was released on October 11, 2024.
